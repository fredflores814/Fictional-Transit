# Fictional-Transit

A repository that generates fictional public transportation data for analysis, visualization, and modeling.

## Overview

Fictional-Transit creates realistic but entirely fictional datasets representing public transportation usage patterns. The generated data includes passenger information, trip metrics, account details, payment preferences, and other variables typically found in transit system analytics.

## Features

- **Passenger Demographics**: Generates passenger IDs, names, and account types with appropriate distributions
- **Transit Usage Patterns**: Models realistic trip frequencies, distances, and commute patterns
- **Account Information**: Creates account creation dates, last active dates, and account age metrics
- **Payment & Discount Data**: Generates fare plan types, payment preferences, and discount eligibility

## Use Cases

This dataset may be valuable for:

1. **Data Scientists**: Testing data analysis and machine learning models without privacy concerns
2. **Transit Analysts**: Simulating transit system usage for planning and optimization
3. **Educational Purposes**: Teaching data analysis techniques with a realistic dataset
4. **Software Development**: Testing transit-related applications with representative data

## Getting Started

The main component is the Jupyter notebook `FicData.ipynb` which contains the code to generate the fictional transit data. The notebook is extensively documented to explain the data generation process.

## Data Generation Methodology

The data generation process involves:

1. Creating foundational variables with realistic distributions
2. Establishing correlations between related variables
3. Deriving secondary metrics from primary variables
4. Introducing controlled randomness to simulate real-world variability
5. Adding appropriate time-based patterns and seasonality
